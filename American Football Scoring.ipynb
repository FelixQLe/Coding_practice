    "There are a few ways we can score in American Football:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 point - After scoring a touchdown, the team can choose to score a field goal\n",
    "- 2 points - (1) after scoring touchdown, a team can choose to score a conversion, when the team attempts to score a secondary touchdown or (2) an uncommon way to score, a safety is score when the opposing team causes the ball to become dead\n",
    "- 3 points - If no touchdown is scored on the possession, a team can attempt to make a field goal\n",
    "- 6 points - Awarded for a touchdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above the potential point values for American Football are:\n",
    "- 2 points - safety\n",
    "- 3 points - only field goal\n",
    "- 6 points - only touchdown\n",
    "- 7 points - touchdown + field goal\n",
    "- 8 points - touchdown + conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a score value, write a function that lists the possible ways the score could achieve\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given the value 10, the potential values are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 8 points (touchdown + conversion) + 2 points (safety)\n",
    "- 6 points (only touchdown) + 2x2 points (safety)\n",
    "- 7 points (touchdown + field goal) + 3 points (only field goal)\n",
    "- 5x2 points (safety)\n",
    "- 2x2 points (safety) + 2x3 points (only field goal)"
